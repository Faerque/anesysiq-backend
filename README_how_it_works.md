# AnesysIQ: Personalized Anesthesia Decision Support System

## Overview

AnesysIQ is an evidence-based decision support system for personalized anesthesia induction planning. The system integrates pharmacogenetic testing, clinical risk factors, and published literature to provide individualized drug selection and dosing recommendations for anesthetic agents.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Patient Data Collection & Validation**

   - Comprehensive patient profiling with clinical and genetic parameters
   - Automatic ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification
   - Evidence-based parameter validation

2. **Route Selection Engine**

   - Intelligent selection between Intravenous (IV) and Inhalation routes
   - Based on patient age, contraindications, and clinical factors
   - Evidence-backed decision algorithms

3. **Agent Selection System**

   - Multi-agent assessment for IV agents (Propofol, Etomidate, Ketamine)
   - Volatile agent evaluation (Sevoflurane, Desflurane, Isoflurane)
   - Contraindication screening and risk assessment

4. **Personalized Dosing Calculator**

   - Pharmacokinetic (PK) genetic adjustments for drug metabolism
   - Pharmacodynamic (PD) genetic adjustments for drug sensitivity
   - Clinical factor integration (age, weight, ASA class, comorbidities)

5. **Risk Assessment & Visualization**
   - Dose-response curve modeling using Emax equations
   - Probability calculations for hypnosis and adverse events
   - Safety window analysis and therapeutic margin evaluation

## How It Works

### Step 1: Patient Data Input

The system collects comprehensive patient information including:

- **Demographics**: Age, weight, height, gender
- **Clinical factors**: Cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, ASA classification
- **PK genetics**: CYP2B6, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, RYR1 variants
- **PD genetics**: GABRA1, COMT, OPRM1, CACNA1C polymorphisms
- **Procedural details**: Surgery duration, neuromonitoring requirements

### Step 2: Route Selection

The RouteSelector class determines optimal administration route:

- **Pediatric preference**: Inhalation for patients <12 years (when implemented)
- **Adult default**: IV route preferred for controllability
- **Contraindication screening**: Assesses route-specific limitations

### Step 3: Agent Selection

The AgentSelector evaluates each agent based on:

- **Patient-specific contraindications**: Medical conditions, genetic variants
- **Evidence-based advantages/disadvantages**: Literature-supported assessments
- **Risk-benefit analysis**: Hemodynamic stability, side effect profiles

### Step 4: Personalized Dosing

The DoseCalculator provides individualized recommendations:

#### Pharmacokinetic Adjustments

- **CYP2B6**: Affects propofol and ketamine metabolism (20-30% contribution)
- **UGT1A9**: Primary propofol glucuronidation pathway (70% of metabolism)
- **CYP3A4**: Major ketamine N-demethylation enzyme
- **CYP2C9**: Minor metabolic pathway contributor

#### Pharmacodynamic Adjustments

- **GABRA1**: GABA-A receptor sensitivity for propofol/etomidate
- **COMT**: Stress response affecting anesthetic requirements
- **OPRM1**: Opioid receptor sensitivity influencing ketamine response
- **CACNA1C**: Calcium channel variants affecting cardiovascular depression

#### Clinical Adjustments

- **Age factors**: Reduced requirements in elderly patients (≥65 years)
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Conservative dosing for hypotension risk
- **ASA class**: Dose modifications based on physiological status

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

The system generates personalized dose-response curves:

- **Hypnosis probability**: Likelihood of achieving loss of consciousness
- **Adverse event probability**: Risk of dose-related complications
- **Therapeutic window**: Efficacy-safety balance analysis
- **Safety margins**: Distance from adverse event thresholds
